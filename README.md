> **IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT DOWNLOADING AI-TOOLKIT SOFTWARE:** Please note that products from both companies Google and Microsoft use a wrong system to detect potentially dangerous downloads. These products are for example the internet browsers Chrome, Internet Explorer and operating system Windows 10. **The problem is that they do not test if there is a valid digital signature** in the downloaded file but they flag all downloads which are not downloaded frequently as potentially dangerous. Software (like the AI-TOOLKIT) which is updated frequently can never collect enough downloads to remove this message. You can disable this wrong behavior e.g. in Windows 10 by **switching OFF the Windows Defender SmartScreen** (Internet Options). This is perfectly safe to do if you have an antivirus software!
